Sure, I'll create a README template for deploying a Perpetuals DEX on the Router blockchain. This will include instructions for setting up the environment, deploying the smart contracts, and interacting with the DEX.

# Perpetuals DEX on Router Blockchain

## Introduction

This project deploys a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading perpetual contracts on the Router blockchain. The DEX allows users to trade perpetual contracts with leverage, offering decentralized and non-custodial trading.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.x or later)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for smart contract development)
- Router blockchain development environment setup
- A Router blockchain wallet and some test tokens for deployment

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/perpetuals-dex-router.git
    cd perpetuals-dex-router
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the Router blockchain settings in the `hardhat.config.js` file:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        router: {
          url: 'https://rpc.routerchain.dev',
          accounts: ['<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>']
        }
      },
      solidity: '0.8.4',
    };
    ```

## Deployment

1. Compile the smart contracts:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

2. Deploy the smart contracts to the Router blockchain:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network router
    ```

    This will output the addresses of the deployed contracts. Note them down for future reference.

## Interacting with the DEX

You can interact with the deployed DEX using a frontend application or directly via Hardhat scripts.

### Using Hardhat scripts

1. To check the status of the DEX, run:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/status.js --network router
    ```

2. To perform trades, run:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/trade.js --network router
    ```

### Using a Frontend Application

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

1. To run the tests, execute:

    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```

    Ensure all tests pass before deploying to the live network.
